Connected Graph

In a connected graph, a path can be found connecting any pair of vertices. This small python script generates a random connected graph given the number of vertices in order to assess how many random edges need to be added to obtain a single connected graph. The iterations are also shown on a 500 ms interval.

Preferential Attachment

This script creates a graph with a preferential attachment behaviour - there are hub nodes with a higher degree than other nodes. Such graphs can be formed by biasing the probability of choosing a given edge target by the degree of that target.

Broadcast Simulation

This script consists in simulating the broadcast of a message using flooding algorithm. Various parameters can be tweaked.
At the end, a graphic with the results of the simulation is shown.

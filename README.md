Connected

This small python program generates a random connected graph given the number of nodes.
The iterations are also shown on a 500 ms interval.

Preferential Attachment

This algorithm creates a graph with preferential attachment. This means that there are hub nodes
which have a higher degree than the other ones.

Broadcast

This script consists in simulating the broadcast of a message using flooding. Various parameters can be tweaked.
In the end it's shown a graphic with the results of the simulation.
